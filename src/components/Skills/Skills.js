        <h2>Skills & Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Since beginning my journey as a freelance developer nearly 10 years
          ago, Iâ€™ve done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and
          collaborated with talented people to create web products for both
          business and consumer use.
        </p>
        <p>
          I create successful responsive websites that are fast, easy to use,
          and built with best practices. The main area of my expertise is
          front-end development, HTML, CSS, JS, building small and medium web
          apps, custom plugins, features, animations, and coding interactive
          layouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have full-stack developer experience with popular open-source
          CMS like (WordPress, Drupal, Magento, Keystone.js and others) .
